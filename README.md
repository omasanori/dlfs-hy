# Deep Learning from Scratch in Hy

## What is this?

This is an attempt to follow 『ゼロから作るDeep Learning』 (Deep Learning from
Scratch), a series of Japanese books describing internals of deep learning
algorithms. The original code is written in Python, but I decided to use the
[Hy](https://hylang.org) programming language. Why? Just for fun.

I use Hy 1.0a4+201.gc0efd94.
