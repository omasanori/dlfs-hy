# Deep Learning from Scratch in Hy

## What is this?

This is an attempt to follow 『ゼロから作るDeep Learning』 (Deep Learning from
Scratch), a series of Japanese books describing internals of deep learning
algorithms. The original code is written in Python, but I decided to use
[Hy](https://hylang.org) just for fun.
